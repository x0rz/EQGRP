This is a basic python script I wrote to help people find if they've been infected by the latest batch of NSA rootkits to be released.
The usage is simple:
cd into the directory holding the script
$ cd ~/Downloads/NSA-Check

to run the script simply type python NSA_Check.py
$ python NSA_Check.py

If you want to record the output to a file that can be done easily with:
$ python NSA_Check.py | cat > output.txt
